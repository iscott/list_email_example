Shopping list example with HTML and plain text email, letter_opener, a little logic in the email, gmail settings (commented out) in development.rb, and modified flash message and redirect on create action.  This is what I walked the class through from scratch in WDI.

Setup:

* bundle install

* rake db:migrate

* rails s

* subl . to open folder structure in sublime
